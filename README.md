# Mathematics behind the Rubik's Cube

52 Page project which talks about the Rubik's Cube in a Group Theory sense. As well as talking about effiency of algorithms when it comes to solving the cube

## Topics Discussed:

  * Alternating and Symmetric Groups
  * Generators and Orbits 
  * Illegal and Legal Rubik's Cube Group
  * 2 by 2 cube and comparisons
  * Gods Algorithm
